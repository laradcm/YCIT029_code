1) setup our basic express server

2) home  page http://localhost:3000/ (root)

3) Check that the user is signed-in
-make a request to the "/me" endpoint which will either give back 200 or 401
-if 201 then they are signed-in.... we'll plan once we get there
-if 401 then the user are not signed-in, redirect to login page
